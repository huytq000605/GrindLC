# 668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table<br> Hard

Nearly everyone has used the Multiplication Table. The multiplication table of size m x n is an integer matrix mat where mat[i][j] == i * j (1-indexed).

Given three integers m, n, and k, return the kth smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: The 5th smallest number is 3.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6th smallest number is 6.
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= m * n`
