# 402. Remove K Digits<br> Medium

Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= num.length <= 10^5`
- `num consists of only digits.`
- `num does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.`
