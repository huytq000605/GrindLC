Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example 1:

Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
</pre>

Constraints:

- `rows == matrix.length`
- `cols == matrix[i].length`
- `0 <= row, cols <= 200`
- `matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.`
