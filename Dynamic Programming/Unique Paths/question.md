# 62. Unique Paths<br> Medium

## A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

Example 2:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.`
