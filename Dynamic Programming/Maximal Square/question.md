<pre>
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
</pre>

Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.`
