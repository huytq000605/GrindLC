# 1187. Make Array Strictly Increasing<br> Hard

Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make arr1 strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can choose two indices 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length and do the assignment arr1[i] = arr2[j].

If there is no way to make arr1 strictly increasing, return -1.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace 5 with 2, then arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7].
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Replace 5 with 3 and then replace 3 with 4. arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^9`
