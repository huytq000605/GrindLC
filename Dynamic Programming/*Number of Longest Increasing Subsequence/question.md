# 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence<br> Medium

Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
