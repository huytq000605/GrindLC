# 593. Valid Square<br> Medium

Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space p1, p2, p3 and p4, return true if the four points construct a square.

The coordinate of a point pi is represented as [xi, yi]. The input is not given in any order.

A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: true
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: p1 = [1,0], p2 = [-1,0], p3 = [0,1], p4 = [0,-1]
Output: true
</pre>

Constraints:

- `p1.length == p2.length == p3.length == p4.length == 2`
- `-10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4`
