# 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K<br> Medium

Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.


Example 1:

<pre>
Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
</pre>

Constraints:

-   `1 <= k <= 10^5`
