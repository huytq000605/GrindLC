# 258. Add Digits<br> Easy

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: num = 0
Output: 0
</pre>

Constraints:

- `0 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`
 
Follow up: Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
