# 2124. Check if All A's Appears Before All B's<br> Easy

Given a string s consisting of only the characters 'a' and 'b', return true if every 'a' appears before every 'b' in the string. Otherwise, return false.


Example 1:

<pre>
Input: s = "aaabbb"
Output: true
Explanation:
The 'a's are at indices 0, 1, and 2, while the 'b's are at indices 3, 4, and 5.
Hence, every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return true.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: s = "abab"
Output: false
Explanation:
There is an 'a' at index 2 and a 'b' at index 1.
Hence, not every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return false.
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.`
