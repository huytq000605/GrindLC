# 78. Subsets<br> Medium

## Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.


Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
 ```

Constraints:

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
* `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
* `All the numbers of nums are unique.`
