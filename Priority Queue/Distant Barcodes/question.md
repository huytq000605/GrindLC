# 1054. Distant Barcodes<br> Medium

In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the ith barcode is barcodes[i].

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.


Example 1:

<pre>
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3,1,2,1,2]
</pre>

Constraints:

- 1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000
- 1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000
