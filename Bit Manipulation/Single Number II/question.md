# 137. Single Number II<br> Medium

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.`
