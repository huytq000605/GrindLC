# 461. Hamming Distance<br> Easy

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
</pre>

Constraints:

- `0 <= x, y <= 2^31 - 1`
