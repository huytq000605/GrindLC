# 1899. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet<br> Medium

A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.

To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].
Return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and last triplets [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]. Update the last triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[2,7,5]]
The target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: triplets = [[1,3,4],[2,5,8]], target = [2,5,8]
Output: true
Explanation: The target triplet [2,5,8] is already an element of triplets.
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= triplets.length <= 10^5`
- `triplets[i].length == target.length == 3`
- `1 <= ai, bi, ci, x, y, z <= 1000`
