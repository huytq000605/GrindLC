# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array<br> Easy

## Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]
</pre>

Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`

Follow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
