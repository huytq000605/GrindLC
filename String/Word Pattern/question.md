# 290. Word Pattern<br> Easy

Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
</pre>

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
</pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= pattern.length <= 300`
- `pattern contains only lower-case English letters.`
- `1 <= s.length <= 3000`
- `s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.`
- `s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.`
- `All the words in s are separated by a single space.`
